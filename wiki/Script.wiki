CrossEPG can run Python script during provider download. Script can download complex data (i.e. download epg from a website, parse HTML code and inject data into CrossEPG internal  database), do some task (i.e. do alias) and much more.
The goal is to merge Ambrosa E2_LOADEPG [http://www.ambrosa.net] with CrossEPG.
