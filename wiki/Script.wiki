#summary HowTo make your own script
= Introduction =

CrossEPG can run Python scripts during provider download. Scripts can download complex data (i.e. download epg from a website, parse HTML code and inject data into CrossEPG internal  database), do some task (i.e. do epg data aliasing) and much more.

The goal is to merge Ambrosa E2_LOADEPG [http://www.ambrosa.net] with CrossEPG.

==BASICS==
Creating a script require some steps.

1)
Make your Python script. The script must be places under _crossepg/scripts/_ directory.
It's better if you create a subdir under _crossepg/scripts/_ . Your script can import some CrossEPG functions (see below) and/or can import some _scriptlib_ function (see below)

2)
Add your script as a new "script provider". You must create a text file _your_script.conf_ and place into _crossepg/providers/_ dir.
{{{
protocol=script
filename=YOURSCRIPT_RELATIVE_PATH.PY
description=A TEXT WITH SCRIPT DESCRIPTION
}}}

Example _crossepg/providers/test_script.conf_
{{{
protocol=script
filename=test.py
description=example test script (do nothing)
}}}

Example _crossepg/providers/rai_script.conf_
{{{
protocol=script
filename=rai/rai.py
description=Italy RAI website (see scripts/rai/rai.conf)
}}}
CrossEPG export some internal function to Python. For convenience I've made a python lib _crossepg/script/lib/scriptlib.py_
